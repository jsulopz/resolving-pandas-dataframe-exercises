# Resolving Pandas DataFrame Exercises

This repository contains a sample of the Learning Materials I use on my lessons to teach Python + Data Science.

The Structure of the Book is as follows:

1. Pandas Chapter
  1. `*solution.ipynb`
  2. Curiosity x Learning Solutions

The `*solution.ipynb` file contains the development of the solution for the challenge. While you go through the notebook, you will encounter clickable yellow cells which opens a new notebook to understand a Curious Concept about Python you may not understand.
